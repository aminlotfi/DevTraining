    <p>
        Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document
        written in a markup language like HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside
        HTML and JavaScript.<br/><br /> CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout,
        colors, and fonts. This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control
        in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by
        specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural
        content.<br/><br />Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different
        styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader),
        and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on
        a mobile device.<br/><br />The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style rule
        applies if more than one rule matches a particular element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable.<br/><br />The
        CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Internet media type (MIME type) text/css
        is registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998). The W3C operates a free CSS validation service for CSS
        documents.<br/><br />In addition to HTML, other markup languages support the use of CSS including XHTML, plain XML, SVG,
        and XUL.
    </p>
    <p id="syntax" style="font-size: 30px; font-weight: bold">Syntax</p>
    <p>
        CSS has a simple syntax and uses a number of English keywords to specify the names of various style properties.
        A style sheet consists of a list of rules. Each rule or rule-set consists of one or more selectors, and a
        declaration block.
    </p>
    <p id="history" style="font-size: 30px; font-weight: bold">History</p>
    <p>
        CSS was first proposed by HÃ¥kon Wium Lie on October 10, 1994. At the time, Lie was working with Tim Berners-Lee
        at CERN. Several other style sheet languages for the web were proposed around the same time, and discussions on
        public mailing lists and inside World Wide Web Consortium resulted in the first W3C CSS Recommendation (CSS1)
        being released in 1996. In particular, a proposal by Bert Bos was influential; he became co-author of CSS1, and
        is regarded as co-creator of CSS.<br/><br />Style sheets have existed in one form or another since the beginnings
        of Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML) in the 1980s, and CSS was developed to provide style sheets for
        the web. One requirement for a web style sheet language was for style sheets to come from different sources on
        the web. Therefore, existing style sheet languages like DSSSL and FOSI were not suitable. CSS, on the other hand,
        let a document's style be influenced by multiple style sheets by way of "cascading" styles.<br/><br />As HTML grew,
        it came to encompass a wider variety of stylistic capabilities to meet the demands of web developers. This
        evolution gave the designer more control over site appearance, at the cost of more complex HTML. Variations in
        web browser implementations, such as ViolaWWW and WorldWideWeb, made consistent site appearance difficult, and
        users had less control over how web content was displayed. The browser/editor developed by Tim Berners-Lee had
        style sheets that were hard-coded into the program. The style sheets could therefore not be linked to documents
        on the web.Robert Cailliau, also of CERN, wanted to separate the structure from the presentation so that different
        style sheets could describe different presentation for printing, screen-based presentations, and editors.

    <p id="support" style="font-size: 30px; font-weight: bold">Browser support</p>
    <p>
        Each web browser uses a layout engine to render web pages, and support for CSS functionality is not consistent
        between them. Because browsers do not parse CSS perfectly, multiple coding techniques have been developed to
        target specific browsers with workarounds (commonly known as CSS hacks or CSS filters). Adoption of new
        functionality in CSS can be hindered by lack of support in major browsers. For example, Internet Explorer was
        slow to add support for many CSS 3 features, which slowed adoption of those features and damaged the browser's
        reputation among developers. In order to ensure a consistent experience for their users, web developers often
        test their sites across multiple operating systems, browsers, and browser versions, increasing development time
        and complexity. Tools such as BrowserStack have been built to reduce the complexity of maintaining these environments.

    <p id="limit" style="font-size: 30px; font-weight: bold">Limitations</p>
    <p>
        <b>Selectors are unable to ascend</b><br />
        CSS currently offers no way to select a parent or ancestor of an element that satisfies certain criteria. CSS
        Selectors Level 4, which is still in Working Draft status, proposes such a selector, but only as part of the
        "complete" selector profile, not the "fast" profile used in dynamic CSS styling. A more advanced selector scheme
        (such as XPath) would enable more sophisticated style sheets. The major reasons for the CSS Working Group previously
        rejecting proposals for parent selectors are related to browser performance and incremental rendering issues.<br /><br />
        <b>Cannot explicitly declare new scope independently of position</b><br/>
        Scoping rules for properties such as z-index look for the closest parent element with a position:absolute or
        position:relative attribute. This odd coupling has undesired effects. For example, it is impossible to avoid
        declaring a new scope when one is forced to adjust an element's position, preventing one from using the desired
        scope of a parent element.<br/><br/>
        <b>Pseudo-class dynamic behavior not controllable</b><br/>
        CSS implements pseudo-classes that allow a degree of user feedback by conditional application of alternate styles.
        One CSS pseudo-class, ":hover" , is dynamic (equivalent of JavaScript "onmouseover") and has potential for abuse
        (e.g., implementing cursor-proximity popups) , but CSS has no ability for a client to disable it (no "disable"-like property)
        or limit its effects (no "nochange"-like values for each property).
