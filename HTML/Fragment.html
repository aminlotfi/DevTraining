                React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces that has taken the web development world by storm.
                React is known for its blazing-fast performance and has spawned an ecosystem of thousands of related modules
                on NPM, and many tooling options. However, in a community that favours choice and flexibility, it can be hard
                to know where to start! Not to worry, some patterns and modules have emerged as best practicesâ€”like Redux for
                managing application state. In this course you'll learn all about how React, Redux and other leading modules
                fit together for a complete picture of app development.

                In this course, Envato Tuts+ instructor Andrew Burgess will get you started building modern web apps with
                React and Redux. Starting from nothing, you'll use these two libraries to build a complete web application.
                You'll start with the simplest possible architecture and slowly build up the app, feature by feature. You'll
                learn about basic concepts like tooling, reducers, and routing. You'll also learn about some more advanced
                techniques like smart and dumb components, pure components, and asynchronous actions. By the end, you'll have
                created a complete flashcards app for learning by spaced repetition.
